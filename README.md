The student grade management system is still mainly to achieve the function of adding, deleting, checking and accessing, and it is easy to achieve this by using PyMySQL to operate the database operations, and a tool class PyMySQLUtils can be defined to simplify the code to avoid redundancy. The graphical interface is designed with Tkinter, importing the tkinter module, creating the root form, adding human-computer interaction controls and writing the corresponding functions, waiting for the user to trigger an event response in the main event loop; the placement of controls requires several trials and changes to find a suitable and relatively beautiful layout, grid is positioned in the form of a table, place() is to give precise coordinates to locate, pack() will be arranged in the way of up and down; relatively difficult is to get the data of the input box, you need to change the type in order to calculate the average score of the test and the number of bits retained and so on; the function of adding, deleting, changing and checking is to first operate the data in the database according to the student number in the input box, then operate the index of the stored data according to the index of the stored student number list in the input box Treeview tree view window control is to add, delete, change, and check the data in the database, the list, and the ttk. Sorting function is to bind the tree_sort_column function to the table header, using the list.sort() method, according to the sorted index shift, rewrite the table header so that it becomes the table header again point reverse order.
